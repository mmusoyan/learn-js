An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

#### what is an expression
- var age = 12;

- age = 2 * (age + 3)

- // i have a friend who likes to drink tea.

#### what is a statement
var a;
var b = 15;
JSON.parse('{"age":42,"name":"susan","hobby":"knitting","food":"ice cream"}');


## JS operators
### binary operators:
operand1 operator operand2
### unary operators:
operand operator
operator operand (delete, typeof)

#### assignment operators
- x = y -> x = y
- x += y ->	x = x + y
- x -= y ->	x = x - y
- x *= y ->	x = x * y
- x /= y ->	x = x / y
- x %= y ->	x = x % y
- x **= y -> x = x ** y

- // assignment operators have a return value
- // destructuring arrays and objects


#### comparison operators
- ==
- !=

- ===
- !==

- \>
- \>=

- \<
- \<=

#### arithmetic operators
- % - remainder
- ++ - increment
- -- - decrement
- \- - unary negation
- \+ - unary plus
- ** - exponentiation

#### logical operators
- && (logical AND)
- || (logical OR)
- ! (logical NOT)

2 * 2 ** 2 - 2 = 16
2 * 2 ** 2 - 2 = 8


#### conditional (ternary) operator

condition ? val1 : val2 if (something) {return val1} else {return val2}

4/2
a = 1, b = 0, c = 3

var oho = a + c > b ? 8 : 2 > 0 ? "23" : 14

a + (c > b ? 8 : 2 > 0 ? "23": 14)


oho?
        ______2________    
u = 1 + (1 < 2 ? 2 : 5)
u = 3

f = 1 + (k = 1 > 2 ? 2 : 5)
