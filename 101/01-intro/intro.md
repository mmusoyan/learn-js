## what is JavaScript?
- Not Java :D
- JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the Web. Other two are HTML and CSS.
- If HTML and CSS are used to give structure and content (HTML) and style (CSS) to web sites, JavaScript adds interactivity.
- In 1995 a guy named brendan eich created the JavaScript language as a lightweight solution for adding dynamic functionality to web sites.

## where is it used?
- Over 97% of websites use it in the browser for web page interactive behavior.
- Around 1.5% of websites use it as a server-side programming language with Node.js.
- Creating web and mobile apps, using tools (frameworks) like React, React Native, Angular, and Vue.
- Writing and running tests on web and mobile apps.
- Creating browser-based games.
- Programming IOT devices.

## JS engines
- In order to work, JavaScript needs an environment. These environmants are called engines.
- Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code:
  - V8 from Google is the most used JavaScript engine. All Chromium-based browsers and Node.js use it.
  - SpiderMonkey is developed by Mozilla for use in Firefox.
  - JavaScriptCore is Apple's engine for its Safari browser.
  - Chakra is the engine of the Internet Explorer browser but Edge was rebuilt as a Chromium-based browser and thus now uses V8.

## Node.js
- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- Node.js lets developers use a single language for the entire web-application development, instead of different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
