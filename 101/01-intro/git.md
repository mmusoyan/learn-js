## git is a version control system:
- lets people write code collaboratively bc code is usually written in teams
- lets people keep track of the changes in their code and gives an opportunity to go back to any earlier version at a given time
- allows people to see the differences and changes to the code they've made overtime
- makes sharing of code easy
- gives ability to view history of file changes (who changed what when)
- has comments about each change for the why (commit messages)
- allows for branching
